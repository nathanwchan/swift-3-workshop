## Lab-4-prework  
#### 1. Ensure in Xcode that you are on the **lab-4** branch.  

## Auto Layout
> Auto Layout is a constraint-based layout system. Auto Layout is the only way to go for properly laying out your interface for multiple screen sizes. Auto Layout is extremely flexible and feature rich. Constraints are the fundamental building block of Auto Layout. Constraints express rules for the layout of elements in your interface.

> Constraints allow us to create relationships between UI objects.

Run the application as it is now.  
In simulator, we can simulate rotating the device while the application is running.  
To do this, hold `cmd` and use the `Right` and `Left` arrow keys to rotate the device.  

Notice that when rotated, our `tableView` no longer takes the entire screen.  
We will fix this using Auto Layout and layout constraints.  

In your project, navigate back to the `Main.storyboard`.  

On the `ViewController`, click the `tableView`.  
Make sure that the `tableView` is highlighted in blue or grey on the left like this:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gR0DUJn.png)  

At the bottom of the storyboard screen, between the storyboard and debugger, you should see a few little buttons.  
Click the `pin` button here:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nSmNeZK.png)  

Make sure that the *Constrain to Margins* box is **unchecked**.  

Click on the dotted red lines surrounding the middle square, and ensure all the values are set to `0` like this:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lhc2yrx.png)  

The click the `Add 4 constraints` button.  

> This just created 4 constraint objects on our `tableView`. These specific constraints create 4 relationships between our `tableView` and the ViewController's `view`. Each one representing left, right, top, and bottom spacing.  In this case we are saying that we always want our `tableView` to be 0 points from the top, bottom, left(or leading), and right(or trailing). This will make our `tableView` essentially take the entire screen.  

Run your application and rotate the device in simulator again.  

Notice how now the `tableView` takes the entire screen, even when rotated.  

We will continue to use Auto Layout to manage the layout of our UI for the duration of the tutorial.  

## Segues  
> A UIStoryboardSegue object is responsible for performing the visual transition between two view controllers. In addition, segue objects are used to prepare for the transition from one view controller to another. Segue objects contain information about the view controllers involved in a transition. When a segue is triggered, but before the visual transition occurs, the storyboard runtime calls the current view controllerâ€™s prepareForSegue:sender: method so that it can pass any needed data to the view controller that is about to be displayed.  

In storyboard, go to our ViewController.  
In the bottom right list of UIElements, search for **button**.  

Drag out a **Bar Button Item** and drop onto the right side of the navigation bar on the `ViewController`:
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ezmw0Ah.png)  

In the attributes inspector, next to **System Item**, use the drop down menu to select the **Add** option. This should turn your button into a `+`.  

We will use this to create new `Todo` items.

In the list of elements, search for **View Controller** and drag out another ViewController onto the storyboard.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1Kgjs11.png)  

Position this viewController however you'd like in storyboard, but you will need to be able to see both your button and the new viewController.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4KSWm8N.png)  

Then, `ctrl+drag` from the `+` button you added to the new ViewController you dropped into storyboard.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/RUpIwYt.png)  

When presented with the above menu, select **Present Modally** from the list.  

You should now see a connection between your 2 view controllers.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/5mePJJJ.png)  

This is a segue.  

Run your app and press the `+` to see that it presents the view controller modally, up from the bottom.  

## UIButton  
> Buttons can do more than just work with storyboard segues. They can also have *actions* that they are associated with. This looks similar to when we created the *outlet* to our tableView. These *actions* are just functions that fire when the user presses the button. We can specify whatever code we'd like.  

Before we continue, we need another subclass of UIViewController for our new View Controller we added.  

As before, navigate to *File > New > File...* but this time, instead of selecting **Swift File**, we want to select **Cocoa Touch Class**.  
Here we can specify what type we'd like to subclass, and in our case, this should be `UIViewController`.  
Then, set the Class name to be `NewTodoViewController`.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mWYVzUv.png)  

In storyboard, select the new ViewController we dropped in.  
At the top of the attributes inspector, select the `Identity Inspector`(It looks kinda like the front of a newspaper..):  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/2zR8ilo.png)  

At the top, we can specify what class/subclass this ViewController is.  
Type in `NewTodoViewController` and make sure to press **ENTER** when your done.  
> This is a very annoying bug that has plagued Xcode for years now... If you don't press enter, the box will still show your subclass name, but it will not apply it to this ViewController, causing a crash that can be very tough to find.  

So, lets search again for a *button* in the UIElements, and drag one out onto the top left corner of our `NewTodoViewController`.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/5aZISlg.png)  

We will again, use auto layout to constrain this button to the top corner.  
Select the `Pin` button again, but this time we only need to select the top and left constraints.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Q9tlZdy.png)  

> We only have to set 2 of the constraints because buttons have an intrinsic content size. This means that they can know their size based on the content they contain. In this case, the font size and button text tell the button how long and tall to be. Keep in mind you are still able to assign additional constraints if you'd like.  

> You may also see some yellow lines appear on your `NewTodoViewController`. This is just auto layout's way of telling you that you have constraints that are good, but that the storyboard doesn't currently reflect those constraints. To fix this, click on the tie-fighter-looking button to the right of the `pin` button and select *Update Frames*.  

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/psLAl92.png)  

Click on the button and in the attributes inspector set the *Title* of the button to be `Close`.  

Open the assistant editor again to get a side by side view of the storyboard and the `NewTodoViewController.swift`.  

Like we did before, `ctrl+drag` from the button to the code but this time, drag to the code underneath `didRecieveMemoryWarning` function.  

In the popup box, change the *connection* from **Outlet** to **Action**.
In the *Name* field, type `closeButtonPressed` and leave everything else the same:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qlpOjiC.png)  

If you close out the *Assistant Editor* and click on `NewTodoViewController` on the left, we should see our new **Action** where we connected it.  

> I have gone ahead and removed the commented out code, feel free to explore this if you'd like, but we won't need it for this demo.  

This is what your `NewTodoViewController.swift` should look like.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qlpOjiC.png)  

We just need to add a single line inside the `closeButtonPressed` function:  
```swift
dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
```  

This will give us a way to dismiss this view controller.  

## UILabel  
> The UILabel class implements a read-only text view. You can use this class to draw one or multiple lines of static text, such as those you might use to identify other parts of your user interface. The base UILabel class provides support for both simple and complex styling of the label text. You can also control over aspects of appearance, such as whether the label uses a shadow or draws with a highlight. If needed, you can customize the appearance of your text further by subclassing.  

> Labels are much like buttons when it comes to Auto Layout. They have an intrinsic size so we are required to implement less constraints.  

Back in storyboard, find our `NewTodoViewController`.  
Search for **label** in the list of UIElements and drag out onto the `NewTodoViewController`.  
Again, in the attributes inspector, we can change the label's *Text*. Change it to be `New Todo:`  

Then, let's assign the label some constraints.  
Click on the `pin` button and set the top constraint, but change the value to `75`.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ACAmdgE.png)  

Instead of setting the left and right, this time we will center the label in it's superview.  
Click the `align` button to the left of the `pin` button and select `Horizontally in Container`. Leave the value at `0`.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QLs3Mzb.png)  

Again, if you see yellow warning lines, go through the same process as above to `Update Frames`.  

## UITextField  
> A UITextField object displays an editable text area in your interface. You use text fields to gather text-based input from the user using the onscreen keyboard. The keyboard is configurable for many different types of input such as plain text, emails, numbers, and so on. Text fields use the target-action mechanism and a delegate object to report changes made during the course of editing.

> Using delegation, we can respond to changes that occur in the UITextfield.  

Search for **text field** in the list of UIElements and drag out a Text Field and drop directly underneath the label we placed a moment ago.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ToezhqF.png)  

Drag the left and right edges out till they "click" and you see the blue guides on the right and left. These are the margins we will use to constrain our text field too.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/t6520WM.png)  

Then we will set the following 3 constraints using the `pin` tool.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/8WfBkJp.png)  

In the attributes inspector, feel free to give your UITextField *placeholder text*.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4NxpqWX.png)  

Now open the assistant editor by `option+click`ing the `NewTodoViewController.swift` file on the left.  

We will need an outlet to our UITextField, so `ctrl+drag` from the text field to the top of our class, like we did with the `tableView`.  
I am going to call mine, `textField` to keep it simple.  
You should see a new `@IBOutlet` to `textfield`.  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4NxpqWX.png)  

Close out the assistant editor and select `NewTodoViewController.swift` on the left.  
Add `UITextFieldDelegate` to the top of your class declaration, again like we did with the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol.  

Then, in `viewDidLoad`, we will assign this class to be the `textField`'s delegate.  
At this point, your `NewTodoViewController` class should look like this:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/bGJ998V.png)  

Now, below our `closeButtonPressed` function, we will add the following function:  
```swift
func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
    
    if let userText = textField.text{
        let todo = Todo(text: userText)
        TodoList.shared.add(todo: todo)
    }
    
    dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    
    return true
}
```  

The function above is one of the delegate methods we get from the `UITextFieldDelegate` protocol.  
This function fires when the user hits the `return` key on the keyboard.  

> The above code checks to see if we have text from the user input into the textfield. If we do, then it stores that value in `userText`. We then use the initializer we made for our Todo class to create a new `Todo` instance. Then, we use the `TodoList` class to add it to our existing todos.  

We can build and run this now to try it out, but there a problem, can you spot it?  

We are successfully adding the `Todo` to our `TodoList` class, but our `ViewController`'s `tableView` needs to reload its data. This will cause it to check again to see how many `Todo`'s `TodoList` has.  

To do this, select `ViewController.swift`, and add the following function:  
```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        
        tableView.reloadData()
    }
```  

> The function above fires every time the this view controller will be displayed on screen. This is perfect for what we want, because each time this view controller gets displayed, we want it to check to make sure it is up to date with our `TodoList`.  

Finally, lets remove the for loop from `viewDidLoad` that was pre-populating our `Todo` items.  

Your `ViewController.swift` class should look something like this:  
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/7531FcN.png)  

Run your application. Our `tableView` should appear empty at first, but add a new Todo item. It should populate into our list of `Todo`'s.  

## Wrap up  
We have covered quite a bit of material today. I would suggest going through and working the Coding Challenges on your own and continuing to research each of the topics we discussed today.  

> Dont forget to commit your work! You worked hard to get here!  

#### Coding Challenges  
> Here are some good challenges to attempt on your own.  

1. There is an issue with the code above. When we create our `TodoList` and close the app, then relaunch, our `TodoList` is empty. This is where Persistence would come into play. To implement persistence into your TodoList Application, I would recommend following this tutorial here: [Persistence Tutorial](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/12/1/setting-up)  

2. Another issue with our TodoList is that users cannot remove Todo items once they are completed. Look into `UITableViewDelegate`. There is a method called `tableView(_:commitEditingStyle:forRowAt:)` that will allow us to implement a "Swipe to Delete". This method will use our `TodoList.shared.remove()` function to remove the `Todo` for the specific index.
